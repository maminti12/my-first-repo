**YOUR FOCUS DETERMINES YOUR REALITY** 
*Qui-Gon: Don't center on your anxieties, Obi-Wan. Keep your concentration here and now, where it belongs.
Obi-Wan: But Master Yoda said I should be mindful of the future.
Qui-Gon: But not at the expense of the moment. Be mindful of the living Force, young Padawan.*

*Something rare is precious,
Study it, do not let it go.
Understand it and make it your own.*
(David Attenborough)
